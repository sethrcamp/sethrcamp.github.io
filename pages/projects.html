        <h2>EQUIPMENT CHECKOUT SYSTEM</h2>
        <p>The equipment checkout system is a project
            currently in progress. The idea, now around five
            years old, is to create a completely automated
            system for the Digital Corps in which students
            can checkout equipment from the Corp's collection.
        </p>
        <p>Personally, I was responsible for the design of the complex
            database, and api functions needed for the project. The bulk
            of my contributions were written in PHP for the backend. This
            project is using Medoo to read and write from the database.</p>
