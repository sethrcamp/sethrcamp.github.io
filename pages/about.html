<div class="descriptions">
    <p class="description-one"> I am currently a Freshman Computer Science major
        and Mathematics minor at Ball State University. I have experience in both
        frontend and backend development, including concepts such as database and
        api design, object-oriented programming, and frameworks. I also have
        experience with the following languages: HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, PHP,
        and XML.
    </p>
    <p class="description-two"> I currently work for the Digital Corps on the Ball
        State University campus. We are a group of students, lead by a few Staff
        members, who are challenged with creating and producing digital content for
        several different clients. Projects of the Corps include web sites, apps
        for both ios and android, web-based software, and more.
    </p>
    <p class="description-three"> While working at the Digital Corps, I have been
        introduced to several industry-standard concepts such as PDO, Medoo,
        AngularJS, PHPMyAdmin, custom API implementation, HTTP requests, MySQL and
        more. Examples of such work can be found under the projects tab at the top
        of the page.
